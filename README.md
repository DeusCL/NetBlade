# NetBlade

## How Does This Thing Work:

For the game Blade Of Darkness, rollback last stable version from Steam. Or the specific files that I have on my PC. At least on my PC works fine.

First, run the python script on the root game directory, then, in the game you will suposed to type the IP address inside the option "Multiplayer" in the main menu. Then, whenever the map is the current specified in the server, the game trying to connect to that server will load that map.

## Done:
- Project uploaded to GitHub.
- Configured all things.
- Hide nametags when the nametag is behind the camera
- Check the drop and throw event

## Testing:
- Nothing yet

## Working on:
- Update the inventory system
- What to do when a player is opening a door or activating a trap?

## TODO:
- Find out why the start of a map is so slow.
- Do the multiplayer menu
- When a player dies, what to do now?
- Synch enemies
- When a player completes the level, what to do now?
